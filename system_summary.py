🚀 SYSTEM OVERVIEW
This is a comprehensive cryptocurrency prediction system that:
• Collects real-time market data from CoinGecko API
• Uses ensemble AI models (technical, sentiment, momentum)
• Generates BUY/SELL/HOLD signals with confidence scores
• Stores predictions in SQLite database with full trade tracking
• Evaluates outcomes after 24 hours using real price data
• Updates model weights using reinforcement learning
• Continuously improves prediction accuracy over time

TARGET PERFORMANCE: 60-70% accuracy, 55%+ win rate
PLATFORM: Mobile-optimized for Replit/Google Colab (<512MB RAM)
