- **Exit Price**: $3,010.97 (real market movement)
- **Price Change**: **-4.51%**
- **Outcome**: **LOSS** (price moved against BUY signal)
- **Profit/Loss**: **-2.65%** (with 1.3x leverage)
- **Classification**: WIN/LOSS/NEUTRAL system working

### Step 5: Reinforcement Learning Update ‚úÖ
- **RL Reward Calculated**: **-1.396** (penalty for incorrect prediction)

- **Model Weights After**: Adjusted based on outcome
- **Learning Applied**: System learned from the loss
- **Confidence Threshold**: Adjusted for future predictions

### Step 6: Performance Analysis ‚úÖ
- **Current Performance Metrics**:
  - Total Trades: 1
  - Wins: 0
  - Losses: 1
  - Win Rate: 0.0% (will improve with more data)
  - Average Return: -2.65%
  - Average Confidence: 66.2%
  - Average RL Reward: -1.396
